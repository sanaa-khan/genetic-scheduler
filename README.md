# Exam Schedule Generator using Genetic Algorithm

## Requirements
- Use any kind of crossover
- Choose any justifiable rate of mutation
- Use roulette wheel selection for selecting potentially useful solutions for recombination

The success of the solution is estimated on fulfillment of given constraints and criteria. Results of testing the algorithm show that all hard constraints are satisfied, while additional criteria is optimised to a certain extent.

## Constraints
There is a set of constraints that needs to be fulfilled.

### Hard Constraints
